{"sword":{"title":"Sword","info_text":"# Definitions\n- The term \"Equal Ping\" refers to both players being within an average of 50ms ping from each other.\n- \"HT\" means \"High Tier.\" For example, \"HT3\" means High Tier 3.\n- \"LT\" means \"Low Tier.\"
For example, \"LT3\" means Low Tier 3.\n- \"FT\" means \"First to.\" For example, a FT10 means First To 10, meaning when one user reaches 10 kills, the duel is over.\n- All tests in the sword gamemode are First To 10 unless stated otherwise in this rubric.\n-
“ms” is milliseconds of delay. It is synonymous with ping. Ex. 100ms (100 Ping).\n- Tier 1 is the highest tier you can receive. Tier 5 is the lowest tier you can receive.\n- There is only 1 HT1, the best player in sword.\n- “Score Ratio” is the ratio
of your wins to your losses. For example, a score of 10-7 would output a score ratio of 1.4. A score of 7-10 would output a score ratio of 0.7. Score ratio is mainly used during cross-region fights where there are multiple FT10s.\n- “Total score” is your
total number of wins compared to your total number of losses against all players you face in a tier test. For example: A score of 10-5, 7-10, and 10-9 will output a total score of 27-24.\n\n# Evaluation Tests (For Unranked to LT3 Players)\n# Information\n-
Your tester won't only base your tier off of the score, they will take into account how well you played.\n- The regions we offer are NA, EU, and AS. If you are not from these regions, pick the one that is closest to you. Please tell your tester if you
are not from these three regions.\n- Make sure you are always at your computer when you are in the queue. If it is your turn and you do not respond within 5 minutes, you will be skipped and will have to join the queue again.\n- The maximum tier you can
receive from an evaluation test is HT3.\n- If you are assigned a LT3 tester, you must beat them with a score of at least 10-7 in order to move on to the HT3 eval.\n- If you are assigned a HT3 tester, you must earn a score of at least 7-10 in order to
move on to the HT3 eval.\n- If you earn the appropriate score against your tester, you will move on to the HT3 eval. The HT3 eval is a process where you are assigned 1 extra HT3 where once again, you will have to earn a score of at least 7-10 in order
to finally receive HT3.\n- If a user avoids combat by purposefully not engaging in the fight for more than five seconds, the round ends and is automatically given to the opponent.\n- If a user lags out on the server they chose, the round is counted towards
the tester.\n- In a test, if the score is 7-0 and the tester is confident about a user’s tier, they may end the test early and give them a tier before the duel is over.\n\n# Process\n- If you are unranked or LT3 and below, you must first request an evaluation
test in the #request-test channel in the Sword PVP Community Discord server.\n- In evaluation tests, once you reach the top of the queue, a tester from the user's own region tests on a server of the user’s choice.\n- Once the fight is over, you will be
given a tier by the tester and the ticket will close. Your tier will also be updated on mctiers.com.\n\n# T2+ Tests (High Tier Tests)\n- A user must already be HT3 to test for LT2.\n- The tier list is required to assign 3 people from the testing user’s
own region and one cross-region fight with an opponent from an adjacent region in the tier the user is testing for.\n- T2+ Tests close after one week of inactivity.\n- Users may retest every 2 months.\n- In order to retire, users must have acquired the
peak tier for their current tier. In order to obtain peak tier you need to have kept your tier for at least 30 days and have 3 or more rank defenses. - When requesting retirement, the user must complete all tickets assigned to them for two weeks following
the date of the retirement request in order to make up for their absence.\n- Users who have had T2+ for more than three months may be retired immediately upon request given that they have completed their ticket assignments consistently during their time
as T2+ and that they complete all open tickets assigned before the date of the retirement request.\n- Users who retired at LT2+ may unretire following the bridge testing process. Upon requesting unretirement, the user will be assigned 1 HT3, 2 LT2s, and
2 HT2s in that order. The user must beat both opponents in each tier before moving on to the next. If the user defeats both HT2 opponents, they will then continue to test for LT1 following the normal guidelines.\n- The minimum score is 7-10 or a score
ratio of 0.7 for each user.\n- The user must have a winning total score across all opponents.\n\n# HT3 -> LT2\n- The user testing for LT2 will be assigned 2 HT3 opponents and 2 LT2 opponents to fight.\n# LT2 -> HT2\n- The user testing for HT2 will be
assigned 2 LT2 and 2 HT2 opponents to fight.\n# HT2 -> LT1\n- The user testing for LT1 will be required to beat every current HT2. The user must fight at least 4 HT2s. Upon beating all HT2s, the user will fight all current LT1s in a first to 20 duel.
These fights must be spectated by tier list staff. If the score ratio of fights with the LT1s is 0.8 or above, the user will be ranked LT1.\n# LT1 -> HT1\n- The user testing for HT1 will be required to beat every current LT1 in a first to 20 duel. After
this, the user must beat the current HT1 in a first to 20 duel. All fights must be spectated by a tier list manager as well as be recorded either by tier list staff or someone participating in the duel. Immediately following the fight with the HT1, the
user will be screen-shared by a network screen-sharer no matter if they win or lose the duel. Upon beating the HT1 and passing the screen-share, the user will be placed at HT1.\n\n# Opponent Order\nWhen being assigned the opponents you have to fight for
your test, your opponents will be chosen through the following order:\n1. An opponent who is from your region.\n2. An opponent from a region when that is adjacent to their own.\n- If this opponent is currently in the same tier as you, you will be required
to beat them on a server where you are below 150ms. Players are allowed to have separate fights on separate servers in order to make the advantages and disadvantages equal out.\n3. An opponent from another region when there is a server where you both
get equal ping.\n- Both your pings must be below 150ms. An example of this would be an AS player fighting an NA player on an EU hosted server, where both might get 140ms.\n\n# Cross-Region Fights\nWhen doing a High Tier Test, the user is required to do
a cross-region fight. In a cross-region fight, the user may fight their opponent on a server hosted both in their region, and their opponent’s region.\n- If the players cannot decide which region to do first, they must flip a coin.\n- Ideally, the person
fighting in the opposite region gets to decide the server. For example, if one is an NA player cross-region fighting an EU player, the NA player will get to pick the EU server and the EU player will get to pick the NA server as long as both choices are
reasonable and agreed upon by both players. Exceptions may apply including, but not limited to, a player intentionally choosing a server where they know the opponent is very laggy.\n- If possible, please do not do cross-region fights if one of you has
more than 150 ms to the other region. In cases like this, contact the tier list admins or manager to decide the best course of action.\n\n# Choosing Servers\nOutside of cross-region tests, if there is a disagreement about which server to fight on, try
to pick the most fair server possible based on criteria such as the ping of both you and your opponent to the server. Keep in mind that opponents are only required to test on verified testing servers listed in #servers in discord. If there is still a
disagreement, please contact a tier list admin or manager.\n\n# Bridge Testing\nBridge testing is a process where users may skip the cooldown period on high tests if the scores against the players in the tier they are testing for are so significant, it
is obvious that the player has a viable chance at earning the next tier. Bridge testing is only used for LT2+.\n\n# Cooldown\n- Players may retake their evaluation test every 30 days.\n- Players may retake their high-test every 60 days.\n\n# Allowed Mods\n#
ALLOWED:\n- Armor HUD/Potion HUD\n- Health Indicators\n- Saturation HUD\n- Exitlag\n- Any texture pack that does not provide an advantage (cosmetic texture packs)\n- Texture packs such as low or no fire, small utilities, small totem pop animation\n- Durability
viewer texture packs\n\n# BANNED:\n- X-ray texture packs\n- Hack/Cheat Clients\n- Mouse Tweaks\n- Item Scroller\n- Auto Clicker mods\n- Tweakaroo\n- Regedits\n- Snaptap\n- Ghast\n- Optimal Aim\n\nThis is not a full list. Any mod that provides a competitive
advantage could be disallowed and result in a permanent punishment without warning. If you are unsure about what mods and packs are allowed, please contact the tier list admins.\n\n# Hacking Subhuman List (Permanent Punishments)\nThis is the list where
hackers are placed. If you are on this list, your punishment is permanent and your tiers are wiped. If you believe that you were falsely put on, you can appeal in the 1.9 Network Hub discord server. If your appeal is successful, you will still have to
retest for a new tier.\nThe following offenses will put you on Hacking Subhuman:\n- Cheating/Hacking\n- Illegal mods\n- Macroing/Autoclicking/Automated inputs\n- Refusing screen-share on a verified testing server, or to a tier list screen-sharer\n- Caught
in Screen-share on a verified testing server, or by a tier list screen-sharer\n- Video Reports\n- Admitting to cheating\n- Ping spoofing (VPNs and ExitLag used for better routing are allowed, although purposefully increasing your ping is not allowed)\n-
Manually disabling essential screen-share programs. (Disabling any service that the Tier List admins think prevents a screenshare)\n- All user bans that occur on verified testing servers after May 1st, 2023 will be added to Hacking Subhuman. If you were
falsely banned after this date and placed on subhuman, you are responsible for appealing your ban through the minecraft server, and presenting that evidence in a sword support ticket in the 1.9 Network Hub discord.\n\n# Tier List Cheaters\nThis is the
list where people who break Tier List rules are placed. These punishments are also permanent.\n- Lying about your region\n- Tier testing with an alt or on someone else’s account\n- Having another user tier test on your account\n- Lying about scores/results\n-
Bypassing/lying about your testing cool-down\n- Blatant cheating [3 MONTH BAN]\n- [Multiple instances of blatant cheating will result in a permanent ban.]\n- Using an advantageous private mod. A private mod is one that is not publicly released such as
if you code a mod for yourself or if you pay a developer to code a mod for you and you do not publicly release this mod. If this mod provides even the tiniest bit of an advantage, it is not allowed. If the Tier List admins consider this mod a \"Hack,\"
you will be permanently banned. This is up to the discretion of the tier list admins.\n\n# Testing Kit\nThis kit is the general kit that is used in all forms of tests.\n- **Sword**:\n- Sweeping Edge III\n- **Armor**:\n- Protection III\n**NO Golden Apples**\n\n#
Demotions\n# LT2-HT1:\n- Players may be demoted for refusing to tier test. For cases where a player is physically able to accept a test and chooses not to.\n- Players may be demoted for being involved in Tier List Cheating such as alting or hacking. If
there is even a slim chance that they obtained their tier illegitimately or assisted someone else, they will be demoted.\n# Warns will be given if:\n- A T2+ dodges a fight they've been assigned to. This rule will be exempted if the user is not physically
able to accept a test and/or cannot perform at their best.\n- A T2+ loses to a user who passed their high tier test for the same tier with a score worse than 6-10 or a score ratio lower than or equal to 0.6.\n- A T2+ loses to a user who failed their high
test.\n# Warns will be removed if:\n- A T2+ wins against a user with a minimum score of 10-6 or a score ratio of 1.6 given that the user fails their high test.\n- A T2+ earns a minimum score of 7-10 or a score ratio of 0.7 with a user who passed their
high test.\n\n# Alternate Testing Scenarios\n- In the event that the exact guidelines for high testing are not available, the user will have a choice between the two options below.\n- In the event that two people in the tier you are testing for are not
available to complete your test, each opponent will be replaced by two of the best opponents in your current tier. The \"best\" players will be chosen by the tier list administration based on factors such as their previous test scores and overall performance
within the gamemode. This rule applies to all high tests. The user MUST fight at least one user from the tier they are trying to test.\nFor Example:\n- In a scenario where there is only 1 HT2 available, the user, instead of fighting 2 HT2s and 2 LT2s,
would instead fight 1 HT2 and 4 LT2s.\n- In the event that there are two people in the tier the user is testing for, but not one from the user’s own region, multiple cross-region tests will be arranged with the benefit of +1 fight added to the user’s
total score in order to compensate for the increased challenge cross-region fights pose. This rule only applies to opponents the user fights that are in the tier the user is testing for, not the tier that the user is already in.\nFor Example:\n- In a
scenario where an NA LT2 tests for HT2 with three HT2s available, one from NA and two from EU, the user would fight one extra cross-region and would have 1 extra round added to their total score at the end of the test. The rule would not apply for 2 LT2s
from a different region if the user were to choose that option.\n\n# Miscellaneous Information\n- “Cracked” players are not allowed to test. This is a Minecraft tier list and we only allow Minecraft players to test.\n- Witnessing someone who uses suspicious
or blatant illegal mods or hacks should be reported with evidence in the 1.9 Network Hub.\n- If you agree to fight someone on a certain server for a test, the scores are final. You cannot blame the server for your loss.\n- Using optimizers to increase
FPS is allowed within the sword community although some optimizers disable critical Windows services required for screen-sharing. Sometimes this leads to false subhumans as screen-sharers are not able to do their job. It is the user’s responsibility to
ensure that the optimizer they are using does not disable essential screen-sharing services.\n- Tier fights will only count if they are conducted in a ticket in the 1.9 Sword PVP Community Discord. Any outside scores will not be accepted.\n- If you lose
access to your account. DO NOT link or test on another account, open a sword support ticket and wait for further instruction.\n- The wording and overall interpretation of these rules is subject to the tier list manager’s discretion.","kit_image":"https://i.imgur.com/TJxa4r5.png"},"uhc":{"title":"UHC","info_text":"#
Definitions\n- The term \"Equal Ping\" refers to both players being within an average of 50ms ping from each other.\n- \"HT\" means \"High Tier.\" For example, \"HT3\" means High Tier 3.\n- \"LT\" means \"Low Tier.\" For example, \"LT3\" means Low Tier
3.\n- \"FT\" means \"First to.\" For example, a FT10 means First to 10.\n- “Evaluation Tier Test” refers to the type of tier test you must do if you are currently Unranked or ranked weaker than High Tier 3 on the tier list\n- “High Tier Test” refers to
the type of tier test you must do if you are currently ranked High Tier 3 or better in the tier list\n- \"Total Score\" refers to the total amount of wins/losses against an opponent. Example: Player loses 8-10 vs. one opponent, then wins 10-5 vs. another
opponent, their overall score would be 18-15.\n\n\n# Evaluation Tier Test Information\n - The tester will not only base your tier off of match score, they will take into account your overall performance.\n - The server regions we test on are North America,
Europe, Asia, and Australia. If you are not from these regions, pick the one that is closest to you. \n - Make sure you are always readily available when you are in the queue. If it is your turn and you do not respond within 5 minutes, you will be skipped
and you will have to wait through the queue once again.\n - Asian and Australian testing is merged. If you are from either of these regions, you might have to fight on the opposite region.\n - The best tier you can receive from an Evaluation Tier Test
is HT3.\n\n# Evaluation/Low Tier Test Process\n - If you are UNRANKED or LT3 or below, you must first request a test in the request channel in the UHC Discord server. \n - Then, you will be entered into a waitlist where you can join a queue once a tester
has become active. \n - Once you have passed the queue, a tester will talk to you in your ticket and will do 3-6 fights to determine your Tier.\n - After fighting, you will be given a tier based on the tester's assessment of your skill within those fights.\n\n#
Evaluation -> HT3 Test\n - If your tester assesses you at HT3 or better, you will be assigned a HT3 opponent to fight in a FT10 in which you must win at least 8 to immediately pass.\n - If you lose this fight with a score of 7-10, you will be assigned
a second HT3 opponent.\n - To pass the test at this stage, you must win against the second HT3 opponent.\n\n\n# High Tier Test Information\n- You must already be HT3 to test for T2.\n- High Tier Tests are a FT10. Your overall score will be taken into
account if there are multiple opponents in the Tier you are testing for.\n- When doing High Tier Test, you must fight the lower tiers first. For instance if a LT2 player tests for HT2, they will first fight their LT2 opponents before fighting their HT2
opponents. \n- In a High Tier Test, if your opponent dodges longer than a week, it can result in punishment. More details can be found in the Demotion section below and in cases like these your tier test may be altered.\n- If a player FULLY lags out in
a fight and they have clipped it or recorded it, they are allowed to re-fight just 1 round as long as the fight was around even. If they were losing the fight, it will be counted as a loss. The lag out must be very clear and recorded. Having your friends
vouch that you lagged out is not enough.\n\n\n# HT3 -> LT2\n1. First, you must fight a High Tier 3 opponent.\n2. If you have a passing score, you will be assigned two LT2 opponents.\n- Minimum score against HT3: 10-7\n- Minimum score against LT2s: 7-10,
total passing score must be within a margin of 3\n\n# LT2 -> HT2\n1. First, you will be assigned a LT2 opponent.\n2. If you have a passing score, you will be assigned two HT2 opponents.\n- Minimum score against LT2: 10-7\n- Minimum score against HT2s:
7-10, total passing score must be within a margin of 3\n\n# HT2 -> LT1\n1. First, you will be assigned two HT2 opponents.\n2. If you have a passing score, you will be assigned to fight every LT1 opponent from your region.\n- Minimum score against HT2s:
10-7\n- Minimum score against LT1s: 7-10, total passing score must be within a margin of 3\n\n# LT1 -> HT1\n1. First, you will be assigned two HT2 opponents.\n2. If you have a passing score, you will be assigned to fight every LT1 opponent from your region.\n3.
After beating the LT1s, you will fight all HT1 players.\n- Minimum score against HT2s: 10-5\n- Minimum score against LT1s: 10-7\n- Minimum score against HT1s: 7-10, total passing score must be within a margin of 3\n\n\n# Opponent Assignment\nWhen being
assigned the opponents you have to fight for your test, your opponents will be chosen with the following priority:\n1. An opponent who is from your region.\n - You will fight these players on a server in your region.\n2. An opponent from another region
when there is a server where you both get equal ping. \n - Both your pings must be below 150ms. An example of this would be an Asian player fighting an NA player on EU, where they might both get 140ms.\n3. An opponent from another region when there is
no server where you both get equal ping.\n - You will do cross-region fights against these players. Cross-region fights are explained below.\n\n\n# Cross-Region Fights\nWhen doing a High Tier Test, you might have to do cross-region fights against people
from another region. In a cross-region fight, you will fight your opponent on the closest region to yourself (FT10) and you will also fight them on the closest region to them (FT10).\n- If you cannot decide which region to do first, do a coinflip.\n-
The minimum score to pass a cross region fight vs. someone above your tier is within a margin of 3, however if you are fighting someone in the same Tier as you, all that matters is that you win.\n- Ideally, the person fighting on the opposite region gets
to decide the server. For example, if you are an NA player cross-region fighting an EU player, you will get to pick the EU server and they will get to pick the NA server as long as both choices are reasonable. Exceptions may apply, including but not limited
to, a player intentionally choosing a server where they know the opponent is very laggy.\n\n\n# Choosing Servers\nIf there is a disagreement about which server to fight on, try to pick the most fair server possible based on criteria such as the ping both
you and your opponent have to the server, the amount of experience you both have with each server, and anything else that may be relevant when selecting a server. If there is still a disagreement, contact a Regulator or higher to help select the objectively
most fair server based on the previously mentioned criteria. \n\n\n# Bridge Testing\nIf you successfully pass a test and win (10-6 or better) against both the people in the tier that you are testing for, you can immediately test for the next tier without
having to fight them again as long as your next test is completed within 30 months of your pass. For instance, if you are a HT3 and you tested for LT2 and beat both your LT2 opponents 10-6, you can skip the requirement to fight LT2s again in your HT2
test as long as the HT2 test is completed within 1 month of when you beat the LT2s. This rule does not apply if you went 10-7 or worse with them in your initial test in which case you will not be put on cooldown but you will still be required to refight
BOTH of them, even if you only lost to one.\n\n\n# Cooldown\n- Failing a test will result in a 30 day cooldown. If you are doing an Evaluation Tier Test and you get placed below HT3, this counts as a failure (even if you achieve your desired rank) and
you will be placed on 30 day cooldown before testing again.\n- Passing a test does not get you put on cooldown; there is no cooldown on successful tests. You are free to keep testing whenever.\n\n\n# Allowed Mods\nALLOWED:\n - Armor HUD/Potion HUD\n -
Saturation HUD\n - Health Indicators\n - No Hurt Cam/Non-Directional Tilting\n - Performance Mods\n - Feather Client\n - Lunar Client\n - Any texture pack that does not provide an unfair advantage (cosmetic texture packs) (exceptions for quality of life
packs below)\n - Quality of life texture packs, such as reduced fire, smaller utilities, etc. are permitted.\n\nBANNED:\n - X-ray texture packs\n - Hack/Cheat Clients\n - Mouse Tweaks\n - Item Scroller\n - Autoclicker Mods\n - Macros\n - Tweakaroo\n -
Freecam\n - Anything that allows you to view the item count of your opponent.\n\nThis is not a full list. Any mod that provides a competitive advantage could be disallowed and result in a PERMANENT punishment without warning. If you are unsure about what
mods and packs are allowed, please contact a Regulator/Admin/Manager.\n\n\n# Demotions\n- Players may be demoted for dodging without valid excuses. In cases where a player dodges 2+ consecutive fights, they can be demoted.\n- Players may be demoted for
being involved in Tier List Rigging such as alting. If there is even a slim possibility that they obtained their tier illegitimately, they can be demoted.\n- Players may be demoted for significant losses against players within or below their tier.\n-
Players may be demoted for losing against lower ranked players that did not pass their tests.\n- Demotions are typically only by one rank unless the player meets the criteria to be demoted multiple ranks. For example, if a HT2 loses 0-10 to three different
LT2 players in a row, they will be demoted to HT3.\n- A \"significant loss\" is defined as 3-10 or worse.\n\n# LT2-HT2 Demotions:\n- 2 significant losses to players in the same tier\n- 1-2 significant losses to anyone below their tier\n\n# LT1-HT1 Demotions
(Stricter Rules):\n- 1 significant loss to players in the same tier\n- 1 loss to anyone below their tier that wasn't within a margin of 3\n\n\n# Alternate Testing Scenarios\n In the event that the required number of people in the tier you are testing
for are not available to complete your test, each of these players will be replaced by two of better players in your current tier. The \"better\" players will be chosen by the tier list regulation/administration team based on factors such as their previous
test scores or overall performance within the gamemode. When selecting opponents it's important to be mindful of which players might be prospects of a higher tier in order to prevent tests from being gatekept from said player(s).\n\n# Example 1 (No Opponents):\nI
am a HT3 testing for T2. However, there are no T2s on the Tier List OR the T2s are dodging/inactive. My test requires me to fight two LT2s meaning I will multiply two by two and instead fight 4 HT3s. These HT3s will be assigned by the staff of the tier
list, who will try to pick the better players within the tier.\n\n# Example 2 (Too few opponents):\nI am a LT2 testing for HT2. My test requires me to fight one LT2 and two HT2s. There are enough LT2s, but there is only one HT2. I need to fight the two
LT2s and also the one HT2. My test requires me to fight one more HT2 but there is no other HT2 on the Tier List. Therefore, I multiply 1 by 2 and fight two strong LT2 players that I have not already fought. These LT2s will be assigned by the staff of
the tier list, who will try to pick the better players in the tier.\n\n\n# Miscellanous Information\n- Cracked players are unable to test, as they will not be able to link any account for the website/waitlist.\n- Witnessing someone who uses suspicious
or blatant illegal mods or hacks should be reported with evidence to a regulator or tier list admin.\n- If you agree to fight someone on a certain server for a test, the scores are final. You can not go back on it and blame the server for your loss.","kit_image":"https://i.imgur.com/kuIe1xs.png"},"neth_pot":{"title":"Netherite

early on will count as a dodge, you may be punished for not completing fights same as a dodge.\n5. Administrators may initiate a re-test if there is a possibility that you are not the proper rank.\n - Spectation help is not allowed unless both players
in a test agree.\n\n# Server selection\n1. If players cannot decide on a server:\n - It will be up to administration.\n - if it's an equal ping fight and there's a disagreement with no second choice for an equal ms server, players will be required to

for HT2, they will fight their LT2 opponents before fighting their HT2 opponents.\n- In a High Tier Test, dodging is a case-by-case situation handled by admins.\n- If a player FULLY lags out in a fight, they are allowed to re-fight that round. The lag
out must be very clear and recorded. Having your friends or individuals in any amount vouch that you lagged out is not enough, ask for them to clip it. If fights are continuously stopped due to lag, administrators will handle the situation.\n- When a
LT2+ player is testing for a higher rank they are still required to defend their current rank while doing their test.\n- In a T2+ fights they should be watched by at least a regulator.\n\nHT3 -> LT2\n\n1. First, you will be assigned two HT3 opponents.

score, they will take into account how well you played.\n- The regions we offer are NA, EU and AS/AU. If you are not from these regions, pick the one that is closest to you.\n- Make sure you are always at your computer when you are in the queue. If it
is your turn and you do not respond within 5 minutes, you will be skipped and you will have to join the queue and wait through it all again.\n- The maximum tier you can receive from a Low Tier Test is LT3.\n\n\n# Low Tier Test Process\n- If you are LT3
or below, you must first request a test in the #test-request channel in the SMP Discord server.\n- Then, you will be entered into a waitlist where you can join a queue once a tester is testing.\n- Once you have passed the queue, a tester will talk to
you in your ticket and will typically do 2-3 fights to gauge your tier. \n- Then, you will be given a tier based on the tester's assessment of your skill.\n- If the tester assesses you to HT3 skill level, you will be required to complete a HT3 test before
receiving your tier\n\n\n# Obtaining HT3\nIf a tester assesses you to be HT3, you will be required to fight a HT3 player before obtaining HT3. They will add a HT3 from your region to the ticket and you will do a tryhard FT4 with them. You must go at least
3-4 in order to pass. If you get a worse score, you fail and you will be placed at LT3 instead.\n\n# High Tier Test Information\n- You must already be HT3 to test for T2.\n- All High Tier Test fights will be FT4.\n- When doing High Tier Test, you must
fight the lower tiers first. For instance, if a player is LT2 testing for HT2, they will fight their LT2 opponents before fighting their HT2 opponents.\n- In a High Tier Test, if your opponent dodges for a certain amount of time, it will count towards
their demotion. More details can be found in the Demotion section below. In this case, you will be assigned a new opponent.\n- If a player FULLY lags out in a fight and they have clipped it or recorded it, they are allowed to re-fight just 1 round as
long as the fight was around even. If they were losing the fight, it will be counted as a loss. The lag out must be very clear and recorded. Having your friends vouch that you lagged out is not enough.\n\nHT3 -> LT2\n1. You will be assigned two HT3 opponents.\n2.
You will be assigned two LT2 opponents.\n- Minimum score against HT3s: 8-4 Total Score Across both fights (Cannot Lose Once)\n- Minimum score against LT2s: 3-4 \n\n\nLT2 -> HT2\n1. First, you will be assigned two LT2 opponents.\n2. Then, you will be assigned
two HT2 opponents.\n- Minimum score against LT2s: 8-4 Total Score Across both fights (Cannot Lose Once)\n- Minimum score against HT2s: 3-4\n\n\nHT2 -> LT1\n1. First, you will be assigned two LT2 and two HT2 Opponents \n2. Then, you will be required to
fight two LT1s.\n- Minimum score against LT2/HT2s: 8-4 Total Score Across both tiers respectively (Cannot Lose Once)\n- Minimum score against LT1s: 3-4\n\n\n\nLT1 -> HT1\n1. First, you will be assigned two LT2 and two HT2 Opponents\n2. Then, you will
be required to fight 2 LT1s.\n3. Then, you will be required to fight 2 HT1s.\n- Minimum score against LT2s: 4-2\n- Minimum score against HT2s: 4-2\n- Minimum Score against LT1s: 4-3\n- Minimum score against HT1s: 3-4\n\nOpponent Order\nWhen being assigned
the opponents you have to fight for your test, your opponents will be chosen off of the following order:\n1. An opponent who is from your region.\n- You will fight these players on a server in your region.\n2. An opponent from another region when there
is a server where you both get equal ping.\n- An example of this would be an Asian player fighting an NA player on EU, where they might both get 140ms. Both your pings should ideally be below 150ms.\n3. Order is for T1 and HT1 tests where your opponents
are chosen based off of skill and not region.\n\nEqual MS\nIn cross-region fights for High Tier Tests, you'll need to ensure both players fight on servers that provide equal ms (defined as being within 35ms of each other). Here's how it works,\nYou and
your opponent will fight on servers that give equal ms to both parties (within 35ms difference). If you can't agree on which server to start, use a coinflip to decide.\n\nChoosing Servers\n\nOutside of Equal MS tests, if there is a disagreement about
which server to fight on, try to pick the most fair server possible based on criteria such as the ping of both you and your opponent to the server, the amount of experience you both have with each server and stuff like that. If there is still a disagreement,
contact the tier list admins or the managers who will pick the objectively most fair server based on the previously mentioned criteria.\n\n\nBridge Testing\n\nIf you successfully pass a test and win well enough against both the people in the tier that
you are testing for, you can immediately test for the next tier without having to fight them again as long as your next test is completed within 30 days of your pass. For instance, if you are a HT3 and you tested for LT2 and beat both your LT2 opponents
8-4 total, you can skip the requirement to fight LT2s again in your HT2 test as long as the HT2 test is completed within 1 month of when you beat the LT2s. This rule does not apply if you had worse scores with them in your initial test in which case you
will not be put on cooldown but you will still be required to refight BOTH of them, even if you only lost to one.\n\nCooldown\n- Failing a test will result in a 30 day cooldown. If you are doing a Low Tier Test and you get placed below HT3, this counts
as a fail and you will also be placed on 30 day cooldown.\n- Passing a test does not get you put on cooldown; there is no cooldown on successful tests. You are free to keep testing whenever.\n\n\n\n# MOD/CLIENT RULES\n\n# ALLOWED \n\n- HUD mods (Potion/Inventory/Saturation/Coords/Armor,

#get-a-test channel in the Axe & Shield Community Discord server. \n- In Evaluation tests, a tester from the user's own region tests on a server of the user’s choice in a first to 18 duel once you reach the top of the queue.\n- Once the fight is over,
you will be given a tier by the tester and the ticket will close.\n\n# High (T2+) Tier Tests\n- A user must already be HT3 to test for LT2. (Exceptions may apply)\n- In order to earn LT2, a user must beat a High Tier 3 Evaluation Tester at least 18-13.
After that, they must fight 2 LT2s and have a score of at least 17-20 with both LT2s.\n- Tier 2 Tests close after two weeks of inactivity.\n- Region does not matter in T2+ tests.\n- Users may retest once every 30 days.\n\n# HT3 -> LT2\n1. First, the user
will be assigned a High Tier 3 Evaluation Tester. You must beat this tester at least 18-13 no matter what in order to move on.\n2. After the tester is defeated, the user will be assigned 2 LT2s to fight. 2 from their own region (one will be assigned from
a different region if there aren't enough LT2s from their own region). The user must have a score of at least 17-20 across both LT2s. \nMinimum score: 17-20.\n\n# LT2 -> HT2\n1. First, the user will be assigned one LT2 that they must beat at least 20-15
to continue. \n2. After the LT2 is defeated, the user will be assigned a HT2 to fight and they must have a score of at least 17-20.\nIn some cases they will be assigned a T1 to fight. This is subject to availability. \n\n# HT2 -> LT1\n1. Every T1 Test
is different, as all tier list admins are involved. However, usually, the user testing for LT1 will fight all current T1s in a first to 40 duel across different regions and servers. These fights will be spectated and supervised by tier list managers.\n\n#
LT1 -> HT1\n1. Once again, every T1 Test is different, as all tier list admins are involved. Usually, the user testing for HT1 will fight all current LT1s and HT1s in a first to 40 duel with multiple managers watching. The user will then be screen-shared
after the duel no matter if they won or lost. If won, and upon passing the screen-share, the user will be ranked HT1.\n\n# Opponent Order\nWhen being assigned the opponents you have to fight for your test, your opponents will be chosen off of the following
order:\n1. An opponent who is from the same tier as you. \n2. An opponent from the tier above you.\n\n# Cross-Region Fights\nWhen doing a High Tier Test, the user may be required to do cross-region fights. In a cross-region fight, the user may fight their
opponent on a server hosted both in their region, and their opponent’s region.\n- If the players cannot decide which region to do first, they must flip a coin.\n- Ideally, the person fighting on the opposite region gets to decide the server. For example,
if one is an NA player cross-region fighting an EU player, the NA player will get to pick the EU server and the EU player will get to pick the NA server as long as both choices are reasonable and agreed upon by both players. Exceptions may apply including,
but not limited to, a player intentionally choosing a server where they know the opponent is very laggy.\n\n# Choosing Servers\nOutside of cross-region tests, if there is a disagreement about which server to fight on, try to pick the most fair server
possible based on criteria such as the ping of both you and your opponent to the server, as well as the amount of experience you both have with each server. Keep in mind that opponents are only required to test on verified testing servers listed in the
Discord. If there is still a disagreement, please contact a tier list admin or manager. \n\n# Cooldown\n- Players may retake their evaluation test every 30 days\n- Players may retake their high-test every 30 days\n\n# Alternative Test Scenarios:\nUnfilled
ranks can negatively impact the competitiveness and activity of T2+ Testing. This situation may lead to unfair gatekeeping and prevent deserving players from reaching higher tiers. To maintain balance, it is important to address unfilled tiers, especially
when T2+ activity is already low.\n\nIdeally, each rank should have at least 1-2 players, unless a player's skill level is very close to the tier below them.\n\nIf the required number of players in the tier you are testing for is unavailable, they will
be replaced by the two best players in your current tier.\n\nIf a HT3 tests for T2 and there are no T2s available or they are inactive, they will fight 4 of the best HT3s instead of three LT2s. The administrators of the tier list will select the top players
in the tier for this substitution.\n\nIf a LT2 tests for HT2 and there is only one HT2 available instead of the required two, they will fight the two LT2s and the one HT2. If there are no additional HT2s on the Tier List, the LT2 will face the two best
LT2 players. The administrators of the tier list will choose these LT2s based on their skill level.\n\nIf there are no HT2 players, but two LT2s clearly outperform everyone else in their tier, these players should be considered for HT2 testing. This ensures
that LT2 players are not hindered by the skill disparity caused by these exceptional players.\n\nIf there are no HT1 players, but two nearly equal LT1s who surpass other players in that tier, their promotion to HT1 should be based on the significant skill
margin compared to HT2 players. This prevents gatekeeping that affects the high tiers (LT1, HT2, and LT2). The decision should not automatically shift every player below the unfilled rank to a higher tier (e.g., HT2s do not suddenly become LT1s). Proper
scores and achievements are still necessary to fill the vacant rank.\n\n# Mod Information\n\nALLOWED:\n- Armor HUD/Potion HUD\n- Saturation HUD\n- Performance Mods\n- Any texture pack that does not provide an advantage (cosmetic texture packs)\n- Texture

allowed, please contact the tier list admins.\n\n# Hacking Subhuman List (Permanent Punishments)\n\nThis is the list where hackers are placed. If you are on this list, your punishment is permanent. If you believe that you were falsely placed into Hacking
Subhuman, you can appeal in the Network Hub Discord server. \n\nThe following non-exhaustive list of actions can result in a placement on the Hacking Subhuman list:\n- Cheating/Hacking\n- Illegal mods\n- Macroing/Autoclicking/Automated inputs\n- Refusing

Manually disabling essential screen-share programs. (Disabling any service that the Tier List admins think prevents a screenshare)\n\n# Tier List Rigging/Cheating List\n\nThis is the list where people who break Tier List rules are placed. These punishments
may vary in duration, depending on the decisions of the tier list admins.\nThe following non-exhaustive list of actions can result in a placement on the Tier List Cheater list:\n- Lying about your region\n- Testing with an alt or on someone else’s account.\n-
Having another user tier test on your account.\n- Lying about scores/results.\n- Bypassing/lying about your testing cool-down.\n- Repeatedly breaking less severe rules listed above .\n- Extremely blatant cheating such as flying. (Note: must be blatant
to 100% of players. If even one player claims you were not blatant, you will be permanently banned. don't risk it.)\n- Ping spoofing (VPNs used for better routing are allowed, but VPNs used to purposefully ping spoof are not allowed)\n- Using an advantageous
private mod. A private mod is one that is not publicly released such as if you code a mod for yourself or if you pay a developer to code a mod for you and you do not publicly release this mod. If this mod provides even the tiniest bit of an advantage,
it is not allowed. If the tier list admins consider this mod a \"Hack,\" you can even be permanently banned. This is all up to the discretion of the tier list admins.\n\n**Additional Kit Info**\nThis exact kit must be used in all forms of tests.\n- Diamond

and will be instantly demoted if they dodge unless special circumstances are present. The user will be informed of this rule before getting demoted.\n- Players may be demoted for being involved in Tier List Cheating such as alting. If there is even a
slim chance that they obtained their tier illegitimately or assisted someone else, they will be demoted.\n- Players may be demoted for losing against lower tiers players that did not pass their tests.\n- Players may be demoted for losing against players
in their same tier or lower tiers depending on score difference.\n\n# Miscellaneous Information\n- “Cracked” players are not allowed to test. This is a Minecraft tier list and we only allow Minecraft players to test.\n- Witnessing someone who uses suspicious
or blatant illegal mods or hacks should be reported with evidence to a regulator or tier list admin\n- If you agree to fight someone on a certain server for a test, the scores are final. You can not go back on it and blame the server for your loss.\n-
